Development Structure
---------------------

The source folder structure is required by the solution & projects to be like
this:-

+-<application>
| +-<tests>
+-Lib
  +-Core
  +-WCL
  +-WMI

The following commands will create that structure by cloning the various
application and library repositories:-

C:\> mkdir Win32\Lib
C:\> git clone https://github.com/chrisoldwood/Core.git Win32\Lib\Core
C:\> git clone https://github.com/chrisoldwood/WCL.git Win32\Lib\WCL
C:\> git clone https://github.com/chrisoldwood/WMI.git Win32\Lib\WMI
